# About hcs0

I am currently a consultant for a secure file transfer software, open source
enthusiast and contributor and currently pursuing further specializing in
information security.

Entering this field has been my goal since mid 2014 having completed a digital
mobile forensics online challenge and finding myself completely engrossed. My
first conference was Black Hat as part of a scholarship program in 2015 and my
first related role in the field was in late 2016.

I am also autodidactic having learnt primarily on my own. I remember at age
11/12 observing how Internet resources loaded on a page to try and gain more XP
points at this online game. I learnt how to code by looking at a website's
source code in my teens.  I learn by doing such as tinkering with my homelabs
(ie Kali on VM and Kali Nethunter on Android, various Linux OS' on live USB
etc).

If you have seen my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahsuarez),
you may have noticed that I have a background in marketing. I'm consolidating my
interest in security with my background in media and communication as I see
gaps in these areas.  For example, my background in medical practice / global
health has piqued my interest in IoT risks/challenges including compliance. My
experience in marketing is an asset in areas involving social media,
communicating technical concepts to other audiences and other issues that are
more consumer-facing.

On a personal note, I enjoy traveling and living outside of my home country of
Australia. I am currently living and traveling in and around Europe.

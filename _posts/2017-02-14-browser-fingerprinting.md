# What is fingerprinting?


# Fingerprinting withing a non-infosec context


# Web browser fingerprinting 

A number of techniques can be made in terms of web browser fingerprinting attempts.  The following is a non-exhaustive list:

- [Canvas fingerprinting](https://browserleaks.com/canvas) which is fingerprinting via the ``<canvas``>  HTML element

- Audio fingerprinting which is conducted via the AudioContext API (in Chrome)

- WebGL fingerprinting via the WebGL API should websites implement WebGL (I have actually created a project in NodeJS and WebGL before!)

- Battery fingerprinting which can be implemented on sites like YouTube.com.

- Keyboard fingerprinting which is done via keypress timings.

I went to a DC11331 meetup in Paris which was at a cool hackerspace called La Paillasse which explores all things open science, open innovation and more.

When I arrived, there was a spread of locks and picks. Someone there explained to me how the picks work and preceeded to show me a certain way of picking locks using two tools below. There is also a certain way of holding locks also which took a bit of time getting used to.

My first lock, I think I picked within a minute. I tried another one but I think the tension was too much even though I could feel the 'pins' start to give way.

There are lock picking tools available online and this one was definitely a complete set.

Why lock picking? It is a tool useful to social engineers but can also open to your eyes to so-called security of locks.

This page is about PGP/MIME and S/MIME use in email.

Originally, I had PGP/MIME set up but what about if a recipient does  not have PGP/MIME set up on their end?  I started looking into S/MIME and have since started signing my emails.  Since you cannot run PGP/MIME and S/MIME together, you only have a choice of implementing one rather than both.


# What is PGP/MIME


## Setting up PGP/MIME


# What is S/MIME

## Setting up S/MIME


# What is the differences between the two?


# Which one should I implement?

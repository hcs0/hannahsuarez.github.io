# Getting started

The quickest way to get started is to go to the
[Ethereum Project](https://www.ethereum.org/) website, read as much as you can,
then go through the process of downloading the Ethereum Wallet, syncing with
the nodes and so on.

It takes a long time, so there are plenty of opportunities to read up on
Ethereum, watch videos, and so on.


# Obtaining Ethereum

You can mine, purchase from a marketplace, you may even arrange to do a trade
(ie real items, services) in exchange.

The quickest way to start out is to obtain Ethereum from a marketplace at the
exchange rate stated in that marketplace.

The other option is mining in which you can either mine with your hardware (own)
or dedicated hardware purchase) or use a cloud mining service.

I have bought Ethereum from a marketplace and currently trying out a cloud
mining service, [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com). The
affiliate code that you can use is **VmbO1P** for 3% off.

In the near future I am looking at the options for my own hardware to mine.


# The Testnet

I guess you can call Testnet as the draft, or as the sandbox.
On Testnet, after syncing, you can mine for 'test' ether which can later be used
for testing out smart contracts.

I've found that Testnet GUI to sometimes be a bit confusing with some details
not syncing up.  This is a good time to check the logs and see what's going on
behind the scenes.

For example:

![Screenshot1](/assets/images/ethnodesync.png)

```
INFO [08-13|11:30:57] Network syncing, will start miner afterwards 
```

The log above indicates that you cannot start mining in Testnet until after the
Ethereum node has finished syncing.


# Smart Contracts

Once you have mined some ether on Testnet, you can then start out looking into
smart contract deployment.

Rather than deploying directly on to production (aka the Main network)

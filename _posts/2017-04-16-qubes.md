I'm currently using VMWare Fusion to attempt install Qubes R3.2. 

# Notes

Below are some of my notes:

- When first setting up the VM, choose Linux > Fedora.  You will see some notes
about choosing Fedora 64-bit but choosing this option hangs the installation
for me. Edit: Although even Fedora has had some unintended consequences.

- Ensure there is at least 2GB for memory or you will see a prompt to increase
space.

- Ensure there is at least 25GB for hard drive space or you will see a prompt
to increase space.

- Trying to finish the installation has been a bit touch and go for me in trying
to get closer to the installation prompt to finalize things.

- Even with no other configuration prior with one of the prompts, this error
message is turning into a roadblock:

```
['usr/sbin/service', 'qubes-netvm', 'start'] failed:
stdout: ""
stder: "Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start  qubes-netvm.service
Job for qubes-netvm.service failed because the control process exited with
error code.  See "systemctl status qubes-netvm.service" and "journalctl -xe"
for details"
```

A quick Google search only yielded this [entry](https://www.mail-archive.com/qubes-users@googlegroups.com/msg04875.html).

- Somehow managed to get it up and running this time around! Looking forward
to exploring Qubes OS on a VM then looking at repurposing one of my laptops
for Qubes.

# What about VirtualBox?

Previously in 2015, I tried to use VirtualBox but yielded no results.

I tried VirtualBox again and so far has only led me to a command-line
installation error:

```
storage configuration failed: autopart failed:
Encryption requested for LUKS device sda2 but no encryption key specified 
for this device.
```

As reported [here on Github](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2113).
